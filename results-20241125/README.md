This data was generated via running the scripts in this repository against https://src.fedoraproject.org/repo/rpm-specs-20241125.tar.xz.
Results may be non-deterministic. `spectool` relies your local system having the correct macro definitions.

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `rpm-specs-20241125.tar.xz` | Collection of `.spec` files used to generate this data. |
| `sources-from-specs.json` | List of source URLs by spec file, generated using `rpm-specs-20241125.tar.xz`. Manually corrected URLs to fix packages that spectool had trouble evaluating macros for. This includes manually fixing issues caused by syntax errors in the .spec file. |
| `hashes-source.csv` | Hashes of remote files listed in `sources-from-specs-original.json` |
| `hashes-lookaside.csv` | Hashes of Fedora's cached copy of remote files listed in `sources-from-specs-original.json` |
